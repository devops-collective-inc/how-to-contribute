# Important Notes
The manuscript/books.txt file and SUMMARY.md file must be kept manually "synced" if you add or remove chapters, re-order chapters, or rename chapters.

Image links should take the form:
`![Image title](images/image_filename.png)`

Note that LeanPub's production of footnotes differs from GitBook when it comes to PDF export - we've found that GitHub does a slightly better job. Use footnotes sparingly, or avoid them altogether.
