# General Instructions

Our books are hosted, in Markdown format, in http://GitHubs.com/devops-collective-inc. So, you'll need a way to **clone** our repositories, such as a GitHub desktop client.

Once you've created a local clone of a book repository, you would (again, using your GitHub software), **create a new branch**. This is where you'll make your contributions.

You can use any Markdown editor. However, we love the GitBook Editor software, because it "understands" the structure of our ebooks.

Once you're done with your contribution, you can **submit a pull request** to us - again, your GitHub software knows how to do this. We'll review the request and, if it works for us, merge your branch into our master branch.

However, it's important that you understand the unique structure of our books' files, because our publishing platforms need the correct structure in order to work properly.
